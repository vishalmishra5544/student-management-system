Student management system:
This project deals with the basic tasks involved for student management system 
like creating a new record for student, displaying existing records, modifying an
existing record, search for an existing record, delete an existing record. 
Here file handling is used so a file containing the details of all the students
will be  created and all operations like search, modify, delete, add new, delete
on the records will be done on this file and thus this file will have  the values
dynamically updated depending on the operations performed on it.

# Programming language used: C++
